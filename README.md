## My homework for the C# Professional course, less-08_pro_Serialization
1. Create a custom type (like a class) and serialize an object of that
    type, given the fact that the state of the object will need to be transmitted over the network.
2. Create a class that supports serialization. Serialize the object of this
    class in XML format. First use the default format and then change it
    so that the field values ??are stored as attributes of the XML elements.
3. Create a new application in which you deserialize the object from the previous example.
    Display the state of the object on the screen.
